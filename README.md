# About Xata

**Serverless database for Jamstack, Low-Code, and more**

Xata is a combination of a relational database, an analytics engine, and a free-text search engine. All made simple by a spreadsheet-like UI and a single powerful data API, with granular security, zero-downtime migrations, subscriptions, ACID transactions, and caching built-in.
